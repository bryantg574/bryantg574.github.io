        &emsp;I am an aspiring computer scientist currently pursuing a Bachelor of Science degree 
        at California State University Dominguez Hills, with an expected graduation date of June 2026. 
        My academic journey has equipped me with a robust foundation in programming languages such as 
        Java, Python, and JavaScript, as well as hands-on experience in web development and software 
        engineering. I have gained practical industry experience through a front-end developer 
        internship, where I managed website content and optimized accessibility features. 
        Additionally, my role as an Apple Computer Science Scholar allowed me to teach young students 
        coding fundamentals, fostering my passion for education and mentorship. I have also 
        participated in Google's Computer Science Summer Institute, further honing my skills 
        through project-based learning and collaborative presentations. Fluent in both English 
        and Spanish, I am driven by a commitment to continuous learning and innovation, eager to 
        contribute to impactful technology projects.
